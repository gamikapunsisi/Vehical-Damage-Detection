# Vehical-Damage-Detection using Image Processing and Deep Learning
# Technologies : Python
# Using Image Processing Libraries - OpenCV, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
# Using Deep Learning Libraries - Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy

# Purpose of project : Its aim to detect damage object in given images.Deep learning and its advances are the primary algorithms that help achieve this task.By the we can easily calculate the damage detection.
# Workflow : we collect images of damaged cars and categorize them according to different damages, namely : Glass-Broken , Scratches, Dents,
